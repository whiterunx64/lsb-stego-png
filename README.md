## Overview
This tool hides text inside a PNG image using LSB steganography. It changes the last bit of the RGB colors to store your message while keeping the image looking the same. The encoder lets you hide a secret password or message, and the decoder reveals it again. This makes it useful for sending passwords more safely, because instead of sending the password as plain text, you place it inside an image, and only someone with the decoder tool can read the hidden message.
